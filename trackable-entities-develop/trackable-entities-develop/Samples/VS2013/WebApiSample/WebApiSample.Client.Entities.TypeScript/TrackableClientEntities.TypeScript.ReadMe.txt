Trackable Client TypeScript Entities ReadMe

This project demonstrates generation of TypeScript client entities using
the EF 6.x Tools for Visual Studio.

To get started, add a new ADO.NET Entity Data Model to the project,
either creating or selecting a data connection.  

After running the tool, delete the generated DbContext, then change
the file extensions from .cs to .ts and copy the TypeScript files
into your client project.
